# Orbit-Determination-Term-Project
This report was for my final project of USC's ASTE 583, Spacecraft Navigation: Principals and Practice. In this project, we were given the tracking data of 1 satellite by three different sensors around the world. We were given the sensors' locations, the uncertainties of each location, and the uncertainties of the measurements taken by each sensor. The goal of the project was to perform a statisitical orbit determination using a batch processor and determine the best estimate of the intitial state as well as its corresponding covariance maxtrix. I was also asked to perform something extra and I decided to compute the ground station tracking custody for one week after the end of the provided tracking data.
